## Description of the repository
This is a repository of a mini Data Analysis I conducted for STAT545. The mini-project is divided in two milestones.

- Milestone 1: consists of a report in R markdown about the exploration of a dataset. The exploration includes manipulating the dataset with dplyr and making some graphs with ggplot2 to answer a research question.

- Milestone 2: is a deeper exploration of tidying data. In addition with special data types analysis as factors and dates. This milestone includes fitting a model, and reading and writing data.

### Apology :pleading_face:
I had trouble pushing from R to github the final versions. Everything seemed to be working properly in my computer, but can not be pushed, which is frustrating. Thus, I had to upload some documents in order to mantain the git hub folders tidy (at least).
